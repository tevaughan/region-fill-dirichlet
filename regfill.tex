   Let $M$ be the set of pixels in a monochromatic image.  Consider any proper
   subset $N \subsetneq M$.  Let $B_N$ be the external boundary of $N$, so that
   $\foreach q \in B_N$, the pixel $q$ is not in $N$ but shares an edge with
   some pixel $p \in N$.  Let $T_N = N \cup B_N$ be the union of $N$ and its
   external boundary.  Let $S \subsetneq M$ be any proper subset of $M$ such
   that $T_S \subsetneq M$ is also a proper subset.  For any pixel $p \in M$,
   let $v_p$ be the original value of $p$.

   I present an algorithm to compute a new value $r_p$ for each pixel $p \in
   S$.  The new value $r_p$ is computed on the basis of a solution to each of
   three discrete-Dirichlet problems.  To wit:
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item For each pixel $p \in S$, compute the value $a_p$ of the solution
         to the discrete-Dirichlet problem for the boundary-values $\{v_q \: |
         \: q \in B_S\}$.
      \item For each pixel $p \in T_S$, compute the value $b_p$ of the solution
         to the discrete-Dirichlet problem for the boundary-values $\{v_q \: |
         \: q \in B_{T_S}\}$.
      \item For each pixel $q$ in $B_S$, compute the value $\sigma_q = |b_q -
         v_q|$, which is taken as an estimate of the standard deviation for
         high-spatial-frequency noise at pixel $q$.
      \item For each pixel $p \in S$, compute the value $\sigma_p$ of the
         solution to the discrete-Dirichlet problem for the boundary-values
         $\{\sigma_q \: | \: q \in B_S\}$.
      \item For each pixel $p \in S$, compute the value $r_p = a_p + n_p$,
         where $n_p$ is a random number drawn from the Gaussian distribution
         whose standard deviation is $\sigma_p$.
   \end{enumerate}
   For an image with noise on the pixel values, this approach produces a filled
   region that does not so obviously stand out to the eye as would merely using
   $r_p = a_p$ for the new value of each pixel $p \in S$.

\section{Introduction}

In the early part of the Fall Semester of 2018, I was helping my son with his
homework for a course in partial differential equations.  He was solving the
two-dimensional version of the Dirichlet Problem: to find for a closed region
$A$ in the plane a function $f: A \rightarrow \R$ obeying Laplace's Equation,
which can be written for Cartesian coordinates as\footnote{%
   I use ``$\partial_x$'' to represent the operator whose meaning is ``the
   first partial derivative with respect to $x$.'' Similarly, my
   ``$\partial_x^2$'' represents the operator whose meaning is ``the second
   partial derivative with respect to $x$.'' I picked up this notation from Ron
   Kantowski, my professor in the quantum-field-theory course that I took in
   graduate school in the early 1990s at the University of Oklahoma.}
\begin{equation}
   \left[\partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2\right] f(x,y) = 0.
\end{equation}
Along the boundary of $A$, the function's value is known ahead of the solution.

While thinking about his problem, I was reminded of a problem that I had faced
in a digital-image-processing course that I took when I was in college,
probably around 1990, as I was finishing my undergraduate studies.
